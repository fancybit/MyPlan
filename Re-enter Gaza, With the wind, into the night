重入加沙 随风入夜
听说格蕾莎支援加沙失败，为了解决问题给出如下建议：
换个路线，从北方南下不经过以色列控制区。
静默通信，直到物资到位，人员撤离。
后面的格蕾莎熟悉。
多想几个其他备用路线。
不要在纪念日。
分三路以上交错进入，交错离开，没人直到格蕾莎在哪一路。
格蕾莎要亲自在现场留下合影，录像，确保不被夺功。
一定要有足够的录像，因为录像AI造假的成本非常高。
应该没有别的了。

Re-enter Gaza. With the wind, into the night.
It is reported that Grisha's attempt to support Gaza failed. Based on this, the following suggestions are provided to fix the issues:
Change the route and head south from the north, not passing through the Israeli-controlled area.
Silent communication, until the supplies arrive and the personnel are evacuated.
Greasha is familiar with the following things.
Plan several other alternative routes.
Not on the anniversary.
Enter and exit in three or more separate lines, with time intersections, so no one knows which line Greasha is in.
Greasha needs to personally take photos and make videos at the scene to ensure no one steals the credit.
Make sure to have sufficient videos, because the cost of AI-generated fake videos is extremely high.
There shouldn't be anything else.
